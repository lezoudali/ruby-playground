##Learning Ruby 
----

Various practice problems I've solved, using ruby, in journey to becoming a programmer.

These problems are from [Ruby Monk Primer](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer) and [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com)
[TestFirst](http://testfirst.org/) and [JumpstartLab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html)
I will update this repo as I solve more problems.
